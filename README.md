# What's PlasmaOS?
_PlasmaOS is a minimal and collaborative kernel written in Assembly (nasm)._

# Why PlasmaOS?
_When I was a kid i always dreamed to create an operating system, finally, this dream became true, it's not easy to create this type of thing but I did it! If you want to support my work download it and give it a try! I'm sure that it's not like Windows or Linux but im proud of it!_
